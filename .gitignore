# This is a comprehensive .gitignore file for a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) project.
# It includes rules for files generated by Gradle, Android Studio, Xcode, and the operating system.

### Build and Generated Files ###
# Ignore all build directories generated by Gradle.
build/
.gradle/
.kotlin/

### Local Configuration Files ###
# The local.properties file contains developer-specific SDK paths and
# other sensitive information that should not be shared.
local.properties

### IDE Files (IntelliJ / Android Studio) ###
# User-specific configuration files and caches.
# It's good practice to keep .idea/workspace.xml and .idea/gradle.xml
# ignored, as they change frequently and are specific to the local environment.
.idea/caches/
.idea/gradle.xml
.idea/misc.xml
.idea/modules.xml
.idea/runConfigurations/
.idea/workspace.xml
.idea/
# Do not ignore .idea/compiler.xml, as it may contain important project settings.

iosApp/build/

# Xcode user settings.
